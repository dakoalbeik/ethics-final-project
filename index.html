                    <h2>Introduction:</h2>
                    <p>With the rise of technology, privacy is becoming a concept of the past. Users are more inclined than ever before to give up their privacy to get their desired level of comfortability. What makes this matter extra critical is that comfortability has no limit, and there is an obvious linear relationship between giving up privacy and having a more comfortable life. </p>
                    <p>As a magician, I thought of something similar to this. Some magicians claim to read minds. They put on acts of entertainment to demonstrate something that seems impossible. These performers are known as mentalists. Hot reading, a technique used by psychics and mentalists to pretend to predict or know something personal about an audience member. This technique requires the performer to know some information about the audience member prior to the performance.</p>

                    <p>In this book, I will compare advertisers and technology companies who gather information about their users with unethical mentalists who get information about their audiences prior to the show. </p>
                    <h2>From the Lens of The Advertiser:</h2>
                    <p>Targeting people to buy certain products or services in the 21st century is not an easy task without leveraging the internet. People don’t go out as often and rarely read advertisement signs on the road anymore. According to <a href="https://www.healthpartners.com">www.healthpartners.com</a>, the average person spends 8.5 hours in front of their screen. This makes social media platforms and websites the perfect platforms to place advertisements.</p>
                    <p>And as great as this is, it doesn’t work as well as it could. This is because the internet is tremendously complex in its users' demographics. </p>

                    <span class="page-number"></span>
                    <p>No one wants to show tax ads to preteens, for example. For that reason, gathering information about a particular user makes it so much easier to advertise to them. Some might say it’s the perfect and only way to land clients. And it turns out that the more you know about someone, the more accurate your advertisement targeting gets. This includes things like the user’s identified gender, their sexual orientation, and much more. None of this information is going to be used against the user, so surely it should be fine. And I’m sure from the user’s point of view, it is better to see ads that are relevant to one’s self than about something completely unrelated. Especially that some users end up satisfied through the purchase that they made after seeing the advertisement.</p>

                    <h2>From the Lens of The Mentalist:</h2>
                    <p>As a performer, it is my job to entertain the crowd. There is something truly remarkable about creating an impossible moment. When a person sees a good piece of magic, they relive a brief moment of their childhood. In the moment of astonishment, people are not afraid to react or be themselves. Because in that very moment, something non-ordinary had just happened. And the more personal the trick is, the better. A magician can perform a trick in many ways. The method that tends to be the most effective is the one that involves something personal of the audience member. For example, if a magician were to have someone pick a card then guess it, then that would be a good trick. But guessing that same person’s date of birth or the last place they vacationed at is much more impressive. This is because at that point the magician is crossing a boundary that people are not accustomed to.  </p>

                <div class="back-content">
                    <span class="page-number"></span>
                    <p>For that reason, cold and hot readings are amazing when it comes down to showcasing great magic. The ability to reveal something personal about someone’s life makes the moment that much more memorable. And none of the information gathered about the person is going to be used against them, so surely it’s okay. Especially that most people share too much about themselves on social media anyway.</p>

                    <h2>Advertiser and Mentalist: Privacy is Overrated:</h2>
                    <p>We live in an amazing age that doesn’t give people much room for privacy. Someone’s good or bad actions are quickly to be revealed to the world. And the person doesn’t even have to have social media for that to be the case. We have all seen videos go viral of people doing ethically questionable things. This is because everyone has a camera on them and the world is constantly being cast to the internet. While some argue that this terrible for society, we see it as part of the inevitable. When the world is constantly watching itself, it leads to people making more careful decisions. Everyone should be aware of what information about their life is public and which is private. Neither of us is spying on people or trying to attain information about them that they aren’t willing to share themselves. We are simply utilizing this information for the benefit and comfort of the ones willing to share more information about themselves. </p>
